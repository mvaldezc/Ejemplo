Within the framework of the OGP Georgia Action Plan 2016-2017, the State Audit Office developed an analytical platform ""Budget Monitor""(2), by means of which the wide public can access information about the state budget, public resources management issues, audit findings, issued recommendations and the state of their implementation(3). While The data is quite comprehensive, it is usually updated quite a bit late than the publication of documents by the Ministry of Finance. Even though Georgia has been scoring fairly high in international rankings in areas such as budget transparency(4), challenges remain in terms of openness. There is still no way to access data in bulk, and the most common formats that are being used to publish, are not ideal for data analysis.

The law establishes the principle that the data produced or collected by the administration, as well as the source codes of its main computer applications, are henceforth to be published online.
The article 14 created the article L.321-4 in the Code of relations between the public and the administration. This article is related to the quality of data, their collection and publication, the coordination of this public service (2). This article L.321-4 is transposed in one decree of application (3) and one order of application (4) that details the legal obligations for public administrations. 
Public finance data are available on the Ministry of Economy of Finance website (5), a dedicated platform for public budget (6), on the French Internal Revenue Service website (7), and on the open data governmental portal (8). We can access the annual national budget, voted as a Finance Act every year by the Parliament (9); expenditures for each administration at the national, regional, local levels (10).

Budget data is available on several data portals, including Germany's open data portal GovData.de (2). Other sources are the website of the Ministry of finance providing an interactive platform to view budget data (3), and the data portal of the Ministry of finance (4) that is the initial provider for the GovData portal. 

The budget code defines the classification for revenue and expenditures: 
- specific type (object)
- functional area
- group 
This classification does not mention any specific international classification but it is expected that this is not an unusual classification. 

Data on specific cross-sectional items such as the SDGs or climate action fall into various categories of the budget and are not displayed on the datasets under assessment. However, this data may be available in other datasets or specific Ministry webpage. 

There is no evidence that the budget data is provided on an accrual basis.

The data assessed covers the federal budget. Individual states have their own budget and Ministries.

Law 151/2015 ""Lei de Enquadramento Orçamental"" (1) sets the regime of the budget process, the rules of execution, accounting and budget and financial reporting, as well as the rules of inspection, control and audit. In terms of publication of data, it is made compulsory for the government to make (aggregated) budget information public. It is put rather simply, with no reference to other requirements to the data.
Also, Law 26/2016 defines rules of access to public administration information (2), and in its Art. 2 it states the Principle of Open Governance, bringing core concepts of open access, but again not dwelling into anything technical or quality-related.

The green provides auxiliary and accounting development information, public investment projects (classified territorially) multi-year information, as well as the personnel and program annexes. The yellow section contains information that explains the large figures contained in the General State Budgets, among other documents, it includes the Economic and Financial Report which, together with information on the Spanish economy and its prospects, includes the main characteristics of the General State Budgets, spending policies, financing of Territorial Administrations, public investment, etc. The grey section includes information such as the previous year's budgets and the current years progress. The blue section gives a cross-sectional view of the General State Budgets and includes the Gender Impact Report, and the Report on the alignment of the General State Budgets with the Sustainable Development Goals of 2030 Agenda.
Evidence that the Budget entries have functional classifications to an internationally agreed standard could not be found but the Resolution of January 20, 2014, of the General Directorate of Budgets, by which the codes that define the economic classification are defined outlines the classifications (2).

The budget proposal, however, is available only in pdf on the Croatian Parliament web page. (2)
On the other hand, spending data for the state budget is presented in the State Treasury application (3) and can be download in bulk (4). All state budget's data share common identifiers following the 
Ordinance on budget classifications. (5) The Ordinance defines administrative, economic, functional, and program classifications. However, data are not presented for cross-cutting programs. The common identifier for budget data is the so-called 'Šifra,' the label in the first column in the budget tables.
Data for the sub-national government and the data on the state-owned enterprises and corporations are available only separately, on their webpages, in different formats, and not always easy to locate.

(1) (2) (3) (4) In 2021, a new law was passed that requires agencies to provide their budget justifications as open data in a centrally located website. Previously, this information was not structured nor centralized. The DATA Act requires agencies to submit open spending data to the Treasury Department in standard formats that support quality and to some extent international standards. USASpending provides an API, bulk data access, and data visualizations on key topics. Recently, because of the CARES Act legislation, all spending for COVID-19 data was tracked and provided on USASpending. (5) 

While the United States continues to make progress with the availability of their budget and spending data, GAO and agency inspectors general highlight that many agencies continue to fail to report required spending data, or report it with errors. (6) (7) There is great opportunity to build out the standard spending data 'object class' field to provide more transparency on government performance. While there is much public information, specific amendments to budgets or inconsistent spending is not structured and would take some research to assess. Unreported spending data is calculated using the difference in the total obligated amount from the Report on Budget Execution and Budgetary Resources (excluding financing accounts) and the total obligated amount reported by agencies to USAspending.gov in 'Account Breakdown by Program Activity & Object Class' data (also called 'File B' data, see the DAIMS data standards for more information).

- Making government budget and spending information easier to find and understand by providing more detail on budget spending plans and budget allocations by departments; 
- Improving the GC InfoBase platform to allow Canadians to easily follow funding and results for all Government of Canada programs (2); 
- Updating the Government of Canada Guidelines on the Reporting of Grants and Contributions Awards to ensure proactive disclosure of grants and contributions data continues to meet Canada's legal and policy requirements;
-Ensuring Canadians and parliamentarians have access to information on the gender and diversity impacts of budget measures by publishing GBA+ for all newly announced budget expenditures and tax measures in future budgets.

Consultations for the Fifth NAP on Open Government related to enhancing fiscal, financial, and corporate transparency reveal that the subject has been a recurring area of interest for Canadians, government stakeholders, industry and civil society.

Comment:
The Estimates present all expenses and capital expenditures that the Government plans to incur over the coming budget year for specified outputs within each vote, including capital injections it plans to make to individual departments.
The Estimates are organised on the basis of 10 sector volumes, with each Vote allocated to one sector. All expenses and capital expenditures require an appropriation (Section 4 of Public Finance Act). Appropriations must be supported by Estimates (Section 13 PFA) and Estimates must state, for each appropriation in an Appropriation Act, the Vote to which the appropriation relates, the Minister responsible for the appropriation, and the department responsible for administering the appropriation (Section 14 PFA).

Expenses are on an accrual basis in accordance with GAAP, reflecting the fact that in New Zealand Parliament appropriates funds on an accrual basis. The cash accounting term ""expenditure"" is not therefore used.",,,,,A.PF.BUDGETSPEND.e.e2,2,51530,0.057,0.02394,0.55,Access Info Europe,Australia and New Zealand,"European Union, United Kingdom, North America, Israel, Australia and New Zealand"

While the classification used by NZ Govt to present budget forecasts is not identical to the IMF's economic classification of expenses, the internationally recognised economic classification (see the IMF's Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001, p.63). the economic classification used can be described as generally compatible with international standards. For the relatively small specific areas/categories in which the NZ Govt.'s economic classification differ (e.g. Official Development Assistance"" classified as part of ""transfer payments and subsidies"" rather than using the GFS category of ""grants""), sufficient information is available in the NZ accounts to support the necessary adjustments or conversion to the GFS classification.",,,,,A.PF.BUDGETSPEND.e.e2,2,51531,0.057,0.02394,0.55,Access Info Europe,Australia and New Zealand,"European Union, United Kingdom, North America, Israel, Australia and New Zealand"

While COFOG indicates that GSF pension expenses should in principle be apportioned across COFOG functions, it is not clear that doing so in New Zealand's case would generate much benefit. New Zealand budget documents use a classification that presents more categories at the top level than the COFOG, but those categories are clearly compatible with either top-level COFOG categories or COFOG subcategories.

For example,
Transport and Communications is a top-level ""Core Crown Expense"" category, while Transport and Communications appear as groups within the COFOG Economic Affairs category",,,,,A.PF.BUDGETSPEND.e.e2,2,51532,0.057,0.02394,0.55,Access Info Europe,Australia and New Zealand,"European Union, United Kingdom, North America, Israel, Australia and New Zealand"

The complete set of Estimates are present across 10 seperate volumes containing vote-specific appropriations. Collectively, the Estimates present all expenses across all votes for each appropriation type as required by law (Section 14 and Section 7.1 of PFA):

Output Expenses (departmental and non-departmental)
Benefit or Related Expenses (non-departmental)
Borrowing Expenses (departmental and non-departmental)
Other Expenses (departmental and non-departmental)
Capital Expenditure (departmental and non-departmental)
Multi-Category Appropriations (departmental and non-departmental)
(unrequited transfer; by borrowing cost; and by other expense,
Output expenses are expenses incurred by departments in supplying a specified category of goods and services (or outputs).

In NZ's output-based system, similarity of goods and services is determined by the nature of the outputs, rather than by similarity of objective or purpose as in a program-based system. However, the categories of appropriations effectively meet the criteria as being programmatic categories at a level of detail below the administrative unit.",,,,,A.PF.BUDGETSPEND.e.e2,2,51533,0.057,0.02394,0.55,Access Info Europe,Australia and New Zealand,"European Union, United Kingdom, North America, Israel, Australia and New Zealand"

Efforts have been made to have an economic transparency portal (3) where budget execution can be found by sector, subject, entity, in a structured manner.

The data held in the Financial Administration System (SIAFI) does not have interconnection with other systems of government entities, due to computer security decisions. This limits the link between financial data with any other system that requires a link and have better information.

(E.g., government budgets, government spending, debt, and borrowing.)",1,justification,"This indicator's framework includes laws related to the publication of budget, spending, income, debt, and non-financial indicators. However, the General Law of Government Accountability was preferred to answer element sub-questions from the ""Provisions for definitions, kinds, and fields,"" the ""Provisions for openness, timing, and structure,"" and the ""Extent"" sections since it covers the whole public sector (1). This law provides criteria about the minimum content and periodicity that the income law, proposed budget, in-year reports, and year-end reports should have. Other laws were used to specify additional spending, debt, or performance reports.
The Federal Law on Budget and Fiscal Responsibility was preferred to answer the ""Provisions for data quality"" since the General Law of Government Accountability only provides general criteria and barely specified responsible government institutions. The Federal Law on Budget and Fiscal Responsibility covers the federal government and state or local government reports when they spend federal resources. Specifics on this matter for state and local government would have to be looked at in each state's law.
To answer if open data is set out in binding policies, laws, or regulations, the keyword ""open data"" was searched in the whole framework. No results were found, except in the Budget Law from 2020. This law establishes that the Ministry of Finance has to publish open data for the proposed budget, the enacted budget, the quarterly spending reports, and the year-end report (2). However, this law is updated every year, and this article didn't appear in the 2021 budget, so it was answered that there only were requirements to publish data.
The Federal of Budget and Fiscal Responsibility, and the Genera Law of Budget Accountability, were used to answer the economic classification disaggregation level. The only specification found on this matter was in the federal law, which specifies that the enacted budget needs to have an annex with budget distribution by the administrative classification and the economic classification at the chapter and concept levels (3). These levels are the most aggregate ones (4). The General Law on Government Accountability only establishes that budget documents need to have an economic classification.

However, the budget spending dataset from the first quarter of 2021 was used to answer most of the ""Data fields and quality"" and the ""Data openness, timing, and structure"" sections. The reason is that this dataset covers all of the budget programs and classifications, has all of the federal government agencies, social security institutions, state-owned enterprises, some public corporations, and transfers to local governments. This dataset is regularly updated and has the necessary identifiers to connect with information regarding investment projects, performance indicators, and procurement processes.
Regarding the question about open official tools available to explore the data, the answer was ""No"" even when Mexico has the Open Fiscal Data Package on its budget transparency platform (1). The reason is that the viewer is updated until 2019 while the dataset has a 2021 update.
The Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) has not evaluated Mexico (2), so this research used normative documents that set classifications to see if they were based on international standards. The administrative classification is based on the Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2011 and Mexico's system of national accounts (3). The economic classification also follows the GFSM and Mexico's system of National Accounts (4). The Functional Classification follows the Classification of Functions of Government, GFSM 2001, and Mexico's system of national accounts (5). The program classification doesn't mention if it follows any standard (6), but the sub-question was answered as ""Yes"" using the PEFA criteria, which states that the program classification may substitute for subfunctional classification it has a level of detail corresponding to the subfunctional classification (7).

According to the Law on Budget system, the draft law on the state budget for the next budget year shall be published in the press within 10 days from the date of its submission to the Parliament of the Republic of Azerbaijan together with the documents specified in Articles 12.1.1 - 12.1.10 (this document includes income, debt, budget, spending, and other public financial information, etc.) of this Law.  (Article 14) (16.12.2016 No462-VQD) (1)
The quarterly report on the execution of the state budget shall be published in the media (Article 20.2) (16.12.2016 No462-VQD) (1). Following this rule, The Ministry of Finance publishes monthly reports.
According to the Freedom of Information Law, the owner of public finance information (state bodies, state-owned companies, etc.) should disclose budget forecasts, reports on the execution of the state budget, and consolidated budget (Article 29) (30.09.2005 № 1024-IIQ) (2). There is no common practice for fulfilling these requirements. Some public organizations, including the Ministry of Finance, systematically open public finance information. The law does not specify if such information should be machine-readable or not. Therefore, it is common that organizations to publish PDF files rather than machine-readable format.
The Cabinet of Ministers' Regulation on 'Information on the annual financial activities of budget organizations, public legal entities established on behalf of the state, extra-budgetary state funds, 30 percent or more of shares (shares) owned by the state, as well as the use of funds provided from the state budget or property allocated to them Rules for Disclosure of Information in Internet Information Resources'  regulates forms off disclosed information.  According to this rule, reports should be published no later than April 30 of the following year (6.11.2018 No504) (4) 
Conclusion
For all public finance, the public entities should disclose financial reports on their web pages. Common practice is to publish basic financial information as a PDF file. There is no source for detailed budget and spending information.

Budget data is available from multiple sources. Budget data is available on governmental websites (2). The development of an online ""Open Budgets"" portal (3) improved the accessibility of budget data at the budget proposal stage. All governmental agencies at the national and subnational levels publish information about their budget at each stage of the budget process (draft, approved budget, report). In general, consolidated information on the budget is regularly published by the Ministry of Finance (2). There are also examples of initiatives to publish budget data from non-governmental organizations. For example, the project ""Open Budget Interactive Map"" (4) is aimed at disclosing budget spending at the sub-national level and contains information about the allocated budget funds for public schools, hospitals, etc. The project was initiated by the NGO ""Public Foundation for Development of Parliamentarism in Kazakhstan"" in collaboration with the Anticorruption agency.

(E.g., government budgets, government spending, debt, and borrowing.)",1,justification,"There are several laws, regulations, and guidance that provide a basis for collecting and publishing data on public finances. Especially, those legal acts aim at increasing transparency, public participation, and public oversight in the use of state and local government funds and assets. Legal acts include the Law on Budget, the Law on Law on Information Transparency and Right to Access Information, the Law on Procurement of Goods, Works and Services with State and Local Funds, and the Law on Glass Wallet.  In addition that, there are two main regulations (guidance) including 'Public Investment Project Planning, Budgeting, Monitoring, and Reporting' and 'Prioritizing and Evaluation Public Investment Projects'(1). Also, the enactment of the Law on Glass Account, advanced efforts toward fiscal transparency and citizen engagement. Especially, the Law on Glass Account resulted in the creation of two web portals for public investments(2) and public funds. The Ministry of Finance administers web portals and publishes data on government budgets, government spending, debt, and borrowing. Therefore, it's apparent that legal frameworks that provide a basis for collecting and publishing data on public finances are well-established in Mongolia. Although the two platforms are fully operational, some data are missing due to the lack of routine monitoring. Therefore,  enforcing is crucial in Mongolia.

Three web portals are administered by the Ministry of Finance(1). But all of the government budget and spending in the three web portals are unavailable as open data as of October 2021. But the portal, 'http://iltod.mof.gov.mn/opendata' is under the construction.  Instead, the National Statistics Office of Mongolia (NSO) shares the historical and up-to-date data with the public. Also, the government budget and spending information are available as open data on the NSO's website(2). Overall, types of data related to the government budget and spending are varied and transparent to some extent. Also, data timing and openness are sufficient. However, there are some limitations related to the data formats and structure; therefore, users are not able to explore the data further and utilize it.

The result indicates a limited disclosure of information on budget documents and places the Republic of Moldova on the 39th place out of 117 countries that were included in the evaluation. OBS 2019 shows an increase in the detail of budget documents, in particular annual reports, although the authorities remain lagging behind in preparing and publishing mid-year reports and also in terms of budgetary discipline.(1)

The BOOST database of government spending has been constantly but slowly updated. The latest data from BOOST is from 2019, as the ministry does not have enough human and financial resources to manage the process at a faster pace. (2)

Data on budget execution is being published by the Ministry of Finance on the open data portal date.gov.md. The data is updated on a monthly basis. (3)

Users can navigate through data about National Public Budget through an interactive tool data that creates data visualization on budget execution. The portal was launched by the Ministry of Finance. (4)

The Statistics Act 2009 authorizes the Statistician General to have access to records (administrative data, financial, geographic information etc.) from other statistics producing agencies.

The Banking Act provides for a mandatory report of the monthly balance sheets of the commercial banks within 21 days after the end of the reference month and imposes penalties in case of non-compliance. With regard to balance of payments statistics, the Banking Act does not specifically identify the compilation of balance of payments statistics as the BoB's responsibility. Therefore, the applicability of this provision depends on the informal intra-government agreement that the BoB assumes this responsibility.

Public Finance Management Act:

Section 45 (2) The Permanent Secretary shall publish an annual report on surcharges, losses
suffered by the Government and on any other matter provided for under this Part.


Section 55(3) The Minister shall, at every budget session of National Assembly, table a report of
the total abandonments and write-offs of public moneys and supplies for the financial year
ending.

As provided for in Section 4 (2) The Permanent Secretary shall publish an annual report on surcharges, losses suffered by the Government and on any other matter provided for under this Part.

It is a comprehensive legal and regulatory framework that guides accountability systems for public resources entrusted to government of Uganda to administer on behalf of Ugandans. It includes the processes for the preparation, approval and management of a transparent, credible and predictable annual budget. The Public Finance Management Act 2015 requires the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development publishes several annual budget information such as background to the budget, the budget framework paper, the budget speech, the Ministerial policy statements, charter of fiscal responsibility, the draft estimates of revenue and expenditure, the public investment plan and the approved estimates for the financial year. It is important to note that this has been the practice for last 5 to 10 years where this information is made available in both hard copies - print media and softcopies - online - Ministry's website and Uganda budget information website(3).

Local (2) finances are also affected by budget transparency in the West African monetary union. An annual report from the West African Monetary Union takes stock of economic developments. Here is an example of the union's annual report (3). Benin is a good student when it comes to budget transparency. The finance law is passed on the right date with the production of all the framework and execution documents for the general state budget. Information on external resource mobilization and debt is also available. Regular arbitration is made with the financial technical partners to guarantee the mobilization of pledges of resources and the efficient consumption of credits and grants. Before the vote on the finance law for each year n + 1, the draft of the general state budget is often made available for criticism by civil society (4) organizations interested in governance. These criticisms shed light on the budget debate in the National Assembly and may induce corrections before the vote. Budget guidelines are specific from one year to the next. They take into account the challenges of the moment.

Section 13 and section 83 of the PFMA requires the Secretary to the Treasury to prepare a consolidated financial statement.

However, there is no specific law, or regulations that places a demand on the Secretary to the Treasury to provide information to the public per se. For example monthly, quarterly or whenever someone asks for it.

Accordingly, to law, financial information can be officially made public after audited and certified by the Auditor General. This is a limitation of the legal framework regarding access to public financial information.

The Access to Information Act, can be used to access specific and relevant information.

The information is partially available on line and off line( visiting a government office). Part of the budget and spending information can be found on the Ministry of Finance website. The chalenge is that the information available on the line may not be comprehensive enough and is not updated regularly. Since there is no legal instrument that requires the Treasury to publish the information. The data available on the website is usually unaudited information, since only after the Auditor General has certified the information or transactions,then the information can be considered official. This aspect of the process is not done to update the records in case, the Auditor General has made some corrections.

Any relevant data can be obtained by invoking the Access to Information Act. The catch word is that ""relevant data"", as the right to access information is not absolute, there are some conditions which should be fulfilled first before the data could be released.

All in all, the budget and spending information is available, but not publically available on line in a comprehensive manner and up todate. No law or regulations compels the authorities to update or publish information to the general public.

Section 33, subsection 3 further stipulates that the national budget be gazetted and then published on the website of the Ministry of Finance(2).
However, these provisions do not specifically require that the data be structured nor do they provide guidelines on the type and quality of data to publish. In the same vein, the Right to Access Information Act is also limited.
